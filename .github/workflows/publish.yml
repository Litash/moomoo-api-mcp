          # If configured for Trusted Publishing, this token input is ignored by the action logic if OIDC works,
          # or we can omit it. However, keeping it allows fallback to 'secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN' if someone
          # prefers the refined token method. The action automatically detects OIDC if 'id-token: write' is set
          # and no password is provided, or if password is provided it uses that.
          # To prefer Trusted Publishing (no secret), we can leave 'password' unset.
          # But for the user's initial setup (token), we need it.
          # The 'gh-action-pypi-publish' docs say: "If you want to use Trusted Publishing, do not provide a username or password."
          # So we will use a conditional or just rely on the user following the guide.
          # RECOMMENDATION: Use Trusted Publishing. We will comment out the password line and advise the user.
          # Updating the plan: We will support BOTH by using the secret if it exists, or OIDC if not.
          # Actually, the action handles `password` being empty by trying OIDC.
