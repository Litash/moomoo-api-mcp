      # We include the publish steps here directly. 
      # Pushing the tag might trigger 'publish.yml', but we can ensure it happens here 
      # or let the tag trigger handle it. 
      # Since pushing a tag triggers 'publish.yml', we can actually STOP here and let that workflow take over.
      # This prevents double-publishing or race conditions.
      # However, if we want to BE SURE, we can verify the tag push worked.
      # Strategy: Let the 'publish.yml' handle the actual publish to keep things DRY.
      # This workflow is just "Bump & Tag".
